# G4 Research State — System Builder Product R&D

Date: 2026-09-19
Status: `RESEARCH_ACTIVE / NON_EXECUTABLE`
Execution authority: NONE

## Purpose

Generation 4 follows G3 architectural closure and studies how the System Builder product should realize that semantic substrate with usable interaction, measurable performance, robust data/infrastructure engineering, controlled lifecycle management, bounded self-management and interoperable capability boundaries. G4 does not reopen G3 and does not authorize implementation, WBS, Work Packages, Sprints, TASKs, migrations or provider adoption.

This file is the compact consolidated state. Detailed evidence, adversarials, trade-offs and source-specific findings live in the dedicated documents under `project_docs/generation-4/research/`; compaction here does not supersede those durable research artifacts.

## Current research families

1. Product UX, Living Canvas & AI-native Builder interaction.
2. Computational Core & Performance Engineering.
3. Data, Persistence, Access & Infrastructure Access Engineering.
4. Data Treatment Engineering.
5. Infrastructure Engineering & Control Plane R&D.
6. Engineering Lifecycle, Product Change & Continuous Improvement.
7. Self-Hosting, Autonomic Control & Bounded Self-Evolution.
8. Shared Semantic Kernel / Capability Exchange Plane / Inter-Capability Boundary Model.

These families may later be deduplicated or recomposed. A research family is not automatically a product module.

## Cross-cutting rules

### Constitutional / product boundaries

- `G3 semantic decision != G4 technology binding`; `Research candidate != implementation authority`.
- `Polyglot-ready != Polyglot-from-day-one`; `Measured bottleneck -> qualified specialization candidate`.
- `Builder != Runtime`; published client runtimes remain autonomous.
- `Projection/index/cache/vector/telemetry != canonical truth`; `AI inference != authority`.
- `Self-managing != unrestricted self-modifying`.
- `Shared primitives != shared business ownership`; `Shared lifecycle semantics != shared authority`.
- `Logical Exchange Plane != single broker`; `Exchange Plane owns exchange semantics; capability owns business semantics`.
- `Interface compatibility != contract compatibility`; compatibility is multidimensional.
- Drivers/adapters/gateways may normalize or mediate only declared semantics; they must not fabricate equivalence or become accidental canonical owners.

### Exchange / effect boundaries

- `Provider ACK != effective state`; `Message/broker acceptance != consumer/business effect`.
- `Trace/correlation != business causation != authority`; `Cross-capability reference != ownership transfer`.
- `Workflow progress != transport progress`; `Compensation != rollback/time reversal`.
- `UNKNOWN` is an evidence-domain disposition, not permission to guess.
- `One interaction kind != one universal linearization point`.
- `Safety != liveness`; `Convergence != invariant preservation`; `Commutativity is contract/invariant-relative`.
- Coordination scope follows the invariant; reservation/escrow is not a universal transaction replacement.
- `Idempotency != fencing`; `Target-local atomicity != cross-domain atomicity`.
- `Right transfer ACK != old holder fenced`; `Fencing token generated != fencing enforced`.
- `Ambiguous rights != free capacity`; holder/node loss does not prove rights safely recoverable.

### Evolution / security / evidence boundaries

- `Latest deployment != in-flight semantic migration`; `Schema compatibility != obligation compatibility`.
- `Historical semantic continuity != historical executable continuity`; `Security retirement != semantic settlement`.
- `Signature/provenance valid != currently security-admissible`; `Previously trusted != indefinitely security-admissible`.
- `Offline autonomy != unlimited stale-security operation`; `Security currentness != business authority currentness`.
- `Revocation effective time != runtime observation time`; `Golden/A-B rollback != security-floor rollback`.
- `Evidence sufficient != payload retained`; `Security evidence store != retention exemption`.
- `No witness != no effect`; `Signed/tamper-evident != non-sensitive/permanently retainable`.

### Privacy / federation / resource-governance boundaries

- `Proof continuity != global identity continuity`; `Dedup scope != global correlation scope`.
- `Proof of predicate != disclosure of source record`; `Federation != trust-domain collapse`.
- `Cryptographic key rotation != semantic identity rotation != correlation-reference rotation`.
- `Cryptographically unlinkable != operationally unlinkable`; privacy guarantees require explicit observer/collusion assumptions.
- `Backpressure != abuse attribution`; rate, quota, cost, concurrency and capacity are distinct dimensions.
- `Accountability for bounded resource consumption != global subject linkability`.
- `No token replay != no Sybil/grant multiplication`; issuance/admission and redemption/spend are separate proof domains.
- `Privacy mechanism != conservation mechanism`; `Anonymous redemption != anonymous minting authority`.
- `Per-issuer uniqueness != federation-wide uniqueness`; anti-Sybil claims must name the proposition and scope actually proven.
- `Token cryptographically valid != issuer remained within issuance authority`.
- `UNKNOWN issuance != free budget`.
- `After-the-fact auditability != pre-issuance conservation`.
- `Aggregate arithmetic proof valid != issuance ledger complete`.
- `Append-only transparency != non-equivocation by itself`.
- `Liability accountability != holder identity disclosure`.
- `Duplicate observation != proven holder abuse`.
- `k-of-n signatures != k independent trust failures`; witness quorum security depends on declared correlated-failure assumptions.
- `New witness policy valid != old/new histories joined`; witness-generation rotation needs qualified transition continuity.
- `Checkpoint non-equivocation != witness-policy non-equivocation`; policy lineage is a separate trust/currentness surface.
- `Quorum-valid checkpoint != sufficiently current checkpoint`; offline validity and freshness are independent.
- `Witness consistency approval != semantic/content monitoring`; witnessing does not confer business authority.

## Latest material consolidation — 2026-09-19

### Witness/log governance & correlated compromise under autonomous federation

Evidence classes: C2SP tlog witness/cosignature/policy/proof specifications; RFC 9162 Certificate Transparency v2; Transparency.dev witness implementations/operations; CoSi decentralized witness-cosigning research; Mog/gossip client-audit research; prior G4 issuer-accountability, privacy/collusion, offline-security and evidence-minimal findings.

Material delta:

- established `k-of-n signatures != k independent trust failures`: quorum count alone does not prove organizational, administrative, software, key-custody, deployment or network independence;
- narrowed witness semantics: a cosignature proves consistency with that witness's qualified remembered frontier, not global latest state, completeness, business correctness or issuer conservation;
- made correlated compromise an explicit bound of the anti-equivocation guarantee rather than an assumed-away failure;
- separated fork prevention under a declared quorum-compromise bound, later fork detection on observer intersection, and global-latest knowledge;
- established `New witness policy valid != old/new histories joined`: witness rotation needs overlap, bridge evidence, independent anchoring or explicit quarantine/incompatibility;
- established `Checkpoint non-equivocation != witness-policy non-equivocation`: policy distribution/lineage itself can split-brain;
- established `Quorum-valid checkpoint != sufficiently current checkpoint`: timestamp/freshness/currentness is application policy and remains representable as stale/UNKNOWN during partition;
- preserved runtime autonomy through locally durable policy/frontier/freshness state and bounded stale behavior rather than live Builder/witness dependency per effect;
- separated witness availability, witness compromise and monitor semantics;
- added witness policy/cosignature topology to the privacy correlation budget;
- preserved `Logical Exchange Plane != one global transparency service`.

No transparency log, witness network, quorum algorithm, consensus protocol, gossip implementation, hardware witness, confidential-computing platform, cloud/HSM/KMS, external anchor or provider was selected.

Highest-value remaining gap: **anti-equivocation policy composition across multiple autonomous transparency domains** — determine how capability-local, issuer-local and security/update evidence compose when their witness policies, currentness horizons and partitions differ; prevent `all green locally` from being mistaken for globally compatible state; and define reconciliation when one domain forks or becomes stale while others continue safely.

## Prior material progression — compact index

Detailed durable evidence remains in the family documents indexed by `README.md`. Prior material deltas include: reservation/escrow and fencing; effect composition; interaction reference models; semantic verification; causal workflow; multidimensional compatibility; hierarchical rights; non-fenceable/heterogeneous effects; in-flight evolution; security retirement/offline floors; evidence-minimal reconciliation; privacy-preserving evidence federation; collusion/metadata side channels; privacy-preserving abuse/rate/cost governance; federated anonymous budget conservation/Sybil resistance; and privacy-preserving issuer accountability/compromise containment.

## Non-goals

- no graph/vector/search/stream/service-mesh/central-exchange/etcd/Kubernetes adoption decision;
- no workflow/saga/migration engine adoption decision;
- no property-testing/deterministic-simulation/checker adoption decision;

## Closure target

G4 should eventually produce a deduplicated capability map; workload/interaction profiles; performance/scale budgets; proof obligations; implementation-independent target product architecture; provider qualification matrices; prototype evidence for high-risk choices; G3->G4 traceability; gap against current SB; and a planning handoff without automatically materializing implementation work.
