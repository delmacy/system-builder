# G4 Research State — System Builder Product R&D

Date: 2026-09-19
Status: `RESEARCH_ACTIVE / NON_EXECUTABLE`
Execution authority: NONE

## Purpose

Generation 4 follows G3 architectural closure and studies how the System Builder product should realize that semantic substrate with usable interaction, measurable performance, robust data/infrastructure engineering, controlled lifecycle management, bounded self-management and interoperable capability boundaries. G4 does not reopen G3 and does not authorize implementation, WBS, Work Packages, Sprints, TASKs, migrations or provider adoption.

This file is the compact consolidated state. Detailed evidence, adversarials, trade-offs and source-specific findings live in the dedicated documents under `project_docs/generation-4/research/`; compaction here does not supersede those durable research artifacts.

## Current research families

1. Product UX, Living Canvas & AI-native Builder interaction.
2. Computational Core & Performance Engineering.
3. Data, Persistence, Access & Infrastructure Access Engineering.
4. Data Treatment Engineering.
5. Infrastructure Engineering & Control Plane R&D.
6. Engineering Lifecycle, Product Change & Continuous Improvement.
7. Self-Hosting, Autonomic Control & Bounded Self-Evolution.
8. Shared Semantic Kernel / Capability Exchange Plane / Inter-Capability Boundary Model.

These families may later be deduplicated or recomposed. A research family is not automatically a product module.

## Cross-cutting rules

### Constitutional / product boundaries

- `G3 semantic decision != G4 technology binding`; `Research candidate != implementation authority`.
- `Polyglot-ready != Polyglot-from-day-one`; `Measured bottleneck -> qualified specialization candidate`.
- `Builder != Runtime`; published client runtimes remain autonomous.
- `Projection/index/cache/vector/telemetry != canonical truth`; `AI inference != authority`.
- `Self-managing != unrestricted self-modifying`.
- `Shared primitives != shared business ownership`; `Shared lifecycle semantics != shared authority`.
- `Logical Exchange Plane != single broker`; `Exchange Plane owns exchange semantics; capability owns business semantics`.
- `Interface compatibility != contract compatibility`; compatibility is multidimensional.
- Drivers/adapters/gateways may normalize or mediate only declared semantics; they must not fabricate equivalence or become accidental canonical owners.

### Exchange / effect boundaries

- `Provider ACK != effective state`; `Message/broker acceptance != consumer/business effect`.
- `Trace/correlation != business causation != authority`; `Cross-capability reference != ownership transfer`.
- `Workflow progress != transport progress`; `Compensation != rollback/time reversal`.
- `UNKNOWN` is an evidence-domain disposition, not permission to guess.
- `One interaction kind != one universal linearization point`.
- `Safety != liveness`; `Convergence != invariant preservation`; `Commutativity is contract/invariant-relative`.
- Coordination scope follows the invariant; reservation/escrow is not a universal transaction replacement.
- `Idempotency != fencing`; `Target-local atomicity != cross-domain atomicity`.
- `Right transfer ACK != old holder fenced`; `Fencing token generated != fencing enforced`.
- `Ambiguous rights != free capacity`; holder/node loss does not prove rights safely recoverable.

### Evolution / security / evidence boundaries

- `Latest deployment != in-flight semantic migration`; `Schema compatibility != obligation compatibility`.
- `Historical semantic continuity != historical executable continuity`; `Security retirement != semantic settlement`.
- `Signature/provenance valid != currently security-admissible`; `Previously trusted != indefinitely security-admissible`.
- `Offline autonomy != unlimited stale-security operation`; `Security currentness != business authority currentness`.
- `Revocation effective time != runtime observation time`; `Golden/A-B rollback != security-floor rollback`.
- `Evidence sufficient != payload retained`; `Security evidence store != retention exemption`.
- `No witness != no effect`; `Signed/tamper-evident != non-sensitive/permanently retainable`.

### Privacy / federation / resource-governance boundaries

- `Proof continuity != global identity continuity`; `Dedup scope != global correlation scope`.
- `Proof of predicate != disclosure of source record`; `Federation != trust-domain collapse`.
- `Cryptographic key rotation != semantic identity rotation != correlation-reference rotation`.
- `Cryptographically unlinkable != operationally unlinkable`; privacy guarantees require explicit observer/collusion assumptions.
- `Backpressure != abuse attribution`; rate, quota, cost, concurrency and capacity are distinct dimensions.
- `Accountability for bounded resource consumption != global subject linkability`.
- `No token replay != no Sybil/grant multiplication`; issuance/admission and redemption/spend are separate proof domains.
- `Privacy mechanism != conservation mechanism`; `Anonymous redemption != anonymous minting authority`.
- `Per-issuer uniqueness != federation-wide uniqueness`; anti-Sybil claims must name the proposition and scope actually proven.
- `Token cryptographically valid != issuer remained within issuance authority`.
- `UNKNOWN issuance != free budget`.
- `After-the-fact auditability != pre-issuance conservation`.
- `Aggregate arithmetic proof valid != issuance ledger complete`.
- `Append-only transparency != non-equivocation by itself`.
- `Liability accountability != holder identity disclosure`.
- `Duplicate observation != proven holder abuse`.

## Latest material consolidation — 2026-09-19

### Privacy-preserving issuer accountability & compromise containment

Evidence classes: IETF RFC 9576/RFC 9578 Privacy Pass; RFC 9162 Certificate Transparency v2; C2SP transparency-log witness/cosignature work; compact e-cash research; prior G4 hierarchical-rights, evidence-minimal, privacy/collusion, abuse-governance and anonymous-budget findings.

Material delta:

- separated preventive conservation from retrospective detection: transparency/commitments can expose violations but cannot retroactively preserve a hard budget;
- decomposed issuer accountability into authorization, conservation, completeness and non-equivocation propositions;
- established `Aggregate arithmetic proof valid != issuance ledger complete`: arithmetic over issuer-selected commitments needs a separately qualified completeness property;
- established `Append-only transparency != non-equivocation by itself`: isolated verifiers may accept distinct locally consistent histories until checkpoints cross an independent observer/witness boundary;
- classified anti-equivocation mechanisms by observer assumptions rather than treating one global log as mandatory;
- established `Liability accountability != holder identity disclosure`: aggregate outstanding liability/checkpoints may be governed without publishing subject-level issuance histories;
- added exculpability: duplicate redemption/effect observation is not sufficient evidence of malicious holder double spending;
- separated compromise, revocation-effective and observer-knowledge times and preserved outstanding liability across issuer/key rotation;
- required rotation/compromise containment not to widen holder correlation silently;
- retained runtime autonomy: offline redemption/currentness behavior follows declared checkpoint/security horizons rather than live Builder reachability.

No credential scheme, zero-knowledge/range-proof system, commitment construction, transparency log, witness topology, threshold protocol, consensus service, issuer implementation or provider was selected.

Highest-value remaining gap: **witness/log governance and correlated compromise under autonomous federation** — determine quorum/witness independence assumptions, witness rotation and split-brain behavior, privacy leakage from checkpoint topology, how offline runtimes decide which checkpoint/witness set is sufficiently current, and which anti-equivocation guarantees survive correlated compromise or long partitions without making one global transparency service a runtime dependency.

## Prior material progression — compact index

Detailed durable evidence remains in the family documents indexed by `README.md`. Prior material deltas include: reservation/escrow and fencing; effect composition; interaction reference models; semantic verification; causal workflow; multidimensional compatibility; hierarchical rights; non-fenceable/heterogeneous effects; in-flight evolution; security retirement/offline floors; evidence-minimal reconciliation; privacy-preserving evidence federation; collusion/metadata side channels; privacy-preserving abuse/rate/cost governance; and federated anonymous budget conservation/Sybil resistance.

## Non-goals

## Closure target

G4 should eventually produce a deduplicated capability map; workload/interaction profiles; performance/scale budgets; proof obligations; implementation-independent target product architecture; provider qualification matrices; prototype evidence for high-risk choices; G3->G4 traceability; gap against current SB; and a planning handoff without automatically materializing implementation work.
